# ChangeLog

Changes:
 - Switched the background picture of the start menu into the picture from Richard, although the background picture of the leveling
   was not to be found.
 - Changed the texture of the buttons of the start menu into a transparent picture. Now clicking on the middle of the left button in
   the picture (start) would switch to the leveling.
 - A basic idea of leveling was created. The only job left is to replace the 3-year-old-niveau pictures with the real textures.
 - Exiting to the start menu during a game will now stop the background music.

Problems/Bugs/To be solved:
 - Still, a button for quitting the game is not created. Nothing else.

Others:
