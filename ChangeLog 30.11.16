# ChangeLog

Changes (30.11.2016):
 - Successfully added a new Startmenu (with a part of a anime-cat, as I do not have the resources from Richard)
 - A Button for starting the game. After clicking on it, the "main" game will be started.
 - Pressing "ESC" during the game would exit to the menu.

Problems/Bugs/To be solved (30.11.2016):
 - The background music does not end automatically as the player exit to the start menu.
   A class for stopping the music is created under PlayScreen.java, but is not used. (@Felix)
 - A button for ESC is not shown in the game. Although pressing ESC on a keyboard would do the job, we should not forget that a button is
   the only way to exit the game on a smartphone.

Others:
 - A button for options and another screen for choosing the levels are to be developed. These should not be so hard, however, it is to be
   thought what we should do with the options. Maybe we could just leave it...
 - The reason why the game crashes at some points is, the block is not really destroyed. I will try to upload a picture so that you could
   see, that Mario could stand on this kind of "destroyed" blocks, which does not happens above a really destroyed block.
