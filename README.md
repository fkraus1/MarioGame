# MarioGame

<h2>The project of P-Seminar Info 2016.</h2>

<p><del><b>IMPORTANT</b>: All the changes from me are written in ChangeLog.txt!!!</del>
<br />They are now also shown here.</p>

<h3>Changelog 30.11.2016:</h3>

<p><b>Changes:</b><ul>
 - Successfully added a new Startmenu (with a part of a anime-cat, as I do not have the resources from Richard)
 <br /><br />- A Button for starting the game. After clicking on it, the "main" game will be started.
 <br /><br />- Pressing "ESC" during the game would exit to the menu.</ul></p></p>

<p><b>Problems/Bugs/To be solved:</b><ul>
 - The background music does not end automatically as the player exit to the start menu. A class for stopping the music is created under PlayScreen.java, but is not used. (@Felix)
 <br /><br />- A button for ESC is not shown in the game. Although pressing ESC on a keyboard would do the job, we should not forget that a button is the only way to exit the game on a smartphone.</ul></p>

<p><b>Others:</b><ul>
 - A button for options and another screen for choosing the levels are to be developed. These should not be so hard, however, it is to be thought what we should do with the options. Maybe we could just leave it...
 <br /><br />- The reason why the game crashes at some points is, the block is not really destroyed. I will try to upload a picture so that you could see, that Mario could stand on this kind of "destroyed" blocks, which does not happens above a really destroyed block.</ul></p>

 <h3>Changelog 07.12.16:</h3>
 
 <p><b>Changes:</b>
 - Switched the background picture of the start menu into the picture from Richard, although the background picture of the leveling was not to be found.
 <br /><br />- Changed the texture of the buttons of the start menu into a transparent picture. Now clicking on the middle of the left button in the picture (start) would switch to the leveling.
 <br /><br />- A basic idea of leveling was created. The only job left is to replace the 3-year-old-niveau pictures with the real textures.
 <br /><br />- Exiting to the start menu during a game will now stop the background music.
 
 <p><b>Problems/Bugs/To be solved:</b>
 - Still, a button for quitting the game is not created. Nothing else.</p>
 
 <p><b>Others:</b>
 - Should there be nothing else to be done, I will start with my portfolio. I will appreciate that if some of you send me the complete BUS-Veranstaltung...</p>
